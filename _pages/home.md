I am an Associate Professor in the [CSTB research team](http://icube-cstb.unistra.fr/fr/index.php/Accueil) (Complex System and Translational Bioinformatics) of the [ICube laboratory](https://icube.unistra.fr/) at the [University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr).

(TL;DR) I'm interested in the study of Complex Systems, in the broadest possible sense. In particular, my current research interests concern Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Intelligent Agents and Multi-Agents systems).

Need to send me a message ? Here is an online [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/3oUYShddAe0gjhfE2).
