## Overview

I am interested in Complex System in general (Complex System theory and modeling). As of today, my research interests specifically concerns machine learning, deep learning, agents and multi-agents systems.

The applications of this work are diverse, and I (try to) contribute in some CSTB team projects such as [POEM](http://poem.unistra.fr/fr/index.php/Accueil) (educational ecosystem), [EASEA](http://easea.unistra.fr/index.php/EASEA_platform) (computing ecosystem), [HOPE](http://hope.unistra.fr/index.php/Accueil) and [RADAR](http://radar.unistra.fr/index.php/Main_Page) (health ecosystem, and in particular Electronic Health Records (EHR)).

In these projects, there are different issues at stake: reliable and robust computerization of medical records (and digital resources in general); data analysis with machine learning algorithms; optimal educational trajectories determination and knowledge maps; ...
